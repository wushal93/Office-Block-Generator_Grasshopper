# Office-Block-Generator_Grasshopper
This tool is designed for automated generation of high-density office building layouts in Rhino/Grasshopper.
By inputting a plot boundary or gird size (x,y), the script automatically recognizes the plot shape and generates building fabrics across different scales, while providing extensive control through adjustable parameters.

Key Features
1️⃣ Automatic Office Layout Generation
  Supports multiple plot scales (1–4 ha, 4–9 ha, and large composite plots)
  Includes various street/block patterns for each scale

2️⃣ Parametric Control
  Planning Indicators: Floor Area Ratio (FAR), building coverage, setbacks
  Morphological Controls: Secondary subdivision, building depth/width, tower size ranges

3️⃣ Adaptive Logic
  Automatically detects plot geometry
  Generates context-sensitive patterns based on open space and buildable area distribution
